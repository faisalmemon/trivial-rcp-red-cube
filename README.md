_Trivial Package presenting a Reality ComposerPro of a Red Cube_

## Background
I wanted to create the simplest visionOS project which presented a 3D cube from a window.

The system seems to want to pull in a swift package comprising the reality composer pro resources.
So I created a fresh RCP project and dropped in a simple red cube.  Then I created a separate project
which imports this package but deletes the boilerplate package and its dependency as a framework.  I am a beginner and I just wanted to
understand the fundamental project structure and resource strategy for a visionOS project.
